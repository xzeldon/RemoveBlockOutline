# RemoveBlockOutline

This mod removes the outlines that get drawn when the player mouse over a block.

> You can Enable/Disable block outline on tilde (`) key. Of course, you can change this key in game settings.

The idea of the mod was taken from [Remove Mouseover Highlight Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/remove-mouseover-highlight).
But this mod uses a Forge mod loader but all the mods I use use a Fabric mod loader.
So i decided to create this mod =)
